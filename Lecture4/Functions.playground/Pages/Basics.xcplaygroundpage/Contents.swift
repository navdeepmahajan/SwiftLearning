//Define a function

//Functions start with keyword - func
//The function is below but can't execute - it is just a reusable piece of code
func sayHello() {
    print("Hello World!!!")
}

//Now, time to execute the re-usable piece of code
//sayHello()


/*
 1. Function is simply a reusable piece of code
 2. Where you invoke the function in the file doesn't matters, Swift is a compiled language
