//Passing arguments
//In swift you label the arguments and your function name is split
//Your function name is actually sayHelloTo
func sayHello(to: String) {
    print("Hello \(to)!!!")
}

//Now, time to execute the re-usable piece of code
sayHello(to: "Navdeep")

/*
 Note: Arguments are passed as let so they are immutable
